Our app uses the camera feature which we understand could be sensitive. This is only used when scanning the QR. You can turn off camera allowance for our app in your phone settings but this will omit the scanning QR feature until it is turned back on. You can turn on or off notifications for your convenience. When entering the app, you have the option to allow notifications and this can always be changed in the iPhone settings.")
